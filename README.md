- create `LeanExpr` -> `egg::Pattern` infrastructure
- create JuniperLean attribute to automatically turn marked theorems into JSON, and export them to a given file
- import JSON in Rust, turn it into a set of rewrites, and use that for the `egg::Runner`
- create build.rs to track Lean files and rerun some Lean command to capture JSON
- split juniper_bin into juniper_repl and juniper_lib
- create system to turn `egg::Explanation` into Lean proofs
